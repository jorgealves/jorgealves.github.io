			<h2>Hey There! 👋</h2>
			<h1>I'm Jorge Alves!</h1>
			<p>
				I'm a Backend Engineer.
			</p>
			<p>Whether if you are a startup founder, a fellow developer, or just someone passionate about technology, I'm here to share insights and experiences.
			</p>
			<p>I’m a software engineer who cares as much about how things are built as why they are built.</p>
			<p>
				Over the years, I’ve worked across infrastructure, backend systems, and automation,
				often at the intersection of engineering rigour, pragmatism, and continuous improvement.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy building systems that are reliable, secure, and maintainable,
				but I’m equally interested in the decisions, trade-offs, and conversations that lead to those systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				I see engineering as more than writing code.
				It’s about understanding constraints, communicating clearly,
				and making deliberate choices that age well over time.</br>
				<ul>
					<li>Clarity over cleverness – readable systems scale better than impressive ones.</li>
					<li>Automation with intent – tooling should remove friction, not add complexity.</li>
					<li>Security and reliability by default – not as afterthoughts.</li>
					<li>Learning in public – reflection is a powerful tool for growth.</li>
				</ul>
				Much of my work revolves around infrastructure, automation, and platform thinking, 
				but I enjoy moving across the stack when it helps solve real problems. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Why this site exists:</br>

				This website serves two purposes:
				<ul>
					<li>First, it’s my portfolio: a place to share proof of concepts, experiments, and work I’m proud of.</li>
					<li>
						Second, and just as important, it’s a writing space. 
						Writing helps me slow down, think clearly, and articulate ideas that are often left implicit 
						in day-to-day engineering work. 
						Through short posts and reflections, I explore lessons learned, 
						challenges faced, and perspectives gained throughout my journey as an engineer.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><u>This is not a place for perfect answers, it's a place for honest thinking.</u></p>
			<p>
				Outside the code I believe good engineers are shaped by more than their tools.</br>
				Curiosity, patience, and empathy matter just as much as technical skill. 
				I try to bring those qualities into my work, my collaborations, and the way I continue to learn.</br>
				If something here resonates with you: whether it’s a project, a post, or a way of thinking, feel free to reach out. 📟
